Solutions contained herein, written in Python 3, may not necessarily be ideal solutions by any means. These are simply my own novice attempts at reaching a valid solution.

`main.py` and `input` located in root are project's working files. Completed days and their related inputs can be located in the folders.

`dayX.Y`
Where `X` is the day number and `Y` is which part of the problem is being solved. Day 1, part 2 is `day1.2`.
